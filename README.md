# HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project

## Project Overview
This project features an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard developed using Power BI, designed to support data-driven decision-making in workforce management. The dashboard provides actionable insights into key HR metrics including employee attrition, salary distribution, educational qualifications, and departmental analysis. By visualizing these trends, the dashboard enables organizations to better understand their workforce dynamics and implement more effective retention and talent strategies.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- Age, Gender, Education, Department
- Job Role, Monthly Income, Total Working Years
- Attrition Status, Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating

File: [HR_Analytics.csv](https://github.com/Mumo-The-Analyst/HR_Analytics_with_PowerBI/blob/main/HR_Analytics.csv)

Sample Rows: 1480 employees.

Attrition Rate: 16.08%.

## Tools Used
- **CSV / Excel Data Sources:** Used as the primary source files to import raw HR data for analysis.
- **Power BI Desktop:** Served as the main platform for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing workforce trends.
- **Power Query:** Utilized for cleaning, transforming, and shaping the data before it was loaded into the data model.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Employed to create custom measures and calculations for insights like attrition rates and salary averages.

## Dashboard Features
- Attrition by Gender, Age & Education
- Attrition by Job Role, Department & Salary Bands
- Attrition Trend Over Years
- Salary Distribution Analysis
- Insightful Visualizations with Interactive Filters

## Key Insights
- **Attrition Rate:** 16.08% of employees left the company.
- **Age Group Impact:** Highest attrition in the 26–35 age group (116).
- **Gender Gap:** More males (151) left than females (87).
- **Job Role Risk:** Lab Technicians (62) and Sales Executives (58) face highest turnover.
- **Salary Factor:** Most attrition from employees earning below $5K (163).
- **Education Trend:** Exits highest among Life Sciences (37) and Medical (26) backgrounds.
**- Tenure Impact:** Attrition peaks within first 2 years of employment (59).

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of workforce analytics by building a comprehensive HR dashboard in Power BI. I enhanced my skills in data modeling, visualization, and deriving strategic insights from employee-related metrics. Here are a few specific things I learned:

- **Data Transformation and Modeling with Power Query:** Working with raw HR data from Excel, I learned how to clean, shape, and structure datasets using Power Query. This included handling missing values, creating custom columns (like age groups and salary bands), and preparing the data model for effective analysis.
- **Strategic HR Insights through DAX and Visualizations:** By applying DAX calculations (such as attrition rate, average income, and segmentation by job role), I gained the ability to derive actionable insights. Visualizing these metrics in Power BI taught me how to identify high-risk areas like departments with high turnover, salary-driven attrition, and tenure-related exit patterns.

## Challenges I Faced
This project was not without its challenges, but it provided good learning opportunities:
- **Visual Design for Insightful Storytelling:** Designing an HR dashboard that balances aesthetics with clarity was a challenge. Selecting the right visual types—such as donut charts for education distribution or line graphs for attrition trends over years—required careful thought to ensure insights were easy to interpret. I had to iterate on colors, layouts, and labeling to make the dashboard intuitive and stakeholder-ready.
- **Measuring Attrition Accurately:** Another challenge was accurately calculating attrition rates, especially distinguishing between total employees and those who left. It required using conditional logic in DAX, managing measures like COUNTROWS for “Yes” values, and applying formatting (e.g., % in cards) correctly. Small missteps in filters or incorrect row context would lead to misleading insights, so attention to detail was crucial.

## Conclusion
This HR Analytics Dashboard project using Power BI has provided valuable insights into workforce trends and key metrics. By leveraging Power BI’s powerful visualization tools, I was able to analyze employee attrition rates, uncovering patterns that inform strategic HR decisions. The integration of data from various HR systems allowed for a comprehensive view of organizational health, highlighting areas for improvement and growth.

This project enhanced my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights, reinforcing the significance of data-driven decision-making in HR. Moving forward, continuous monitoring and analysis will be critical for optimizing talent management and fostering a more productive, engaged workforce. This project marks an important step in applying analytics to solve real-world business challenges and refine HR practices.
